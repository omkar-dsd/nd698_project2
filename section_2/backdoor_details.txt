Malicious Process: remotesec
Justification:

1. From the process info it is clear that the process is executing from the temp directory, which is a non standard directory for process configuration/executables. The process name is suspicious towards some remote connection/activity.
root      1028  0.0  0.0   2592   316 ?        SN   05:00   0:00 /tmp/remotesec -k -l 56565

2. Also it is observable that the content of this script is not much human friendly, but from whatever is readable, it can be deduced that the script is performing something related to Socket Connection, Remote Connection, Authentication and Authorization which makes it eligible for red flagging.


3. When we continue observing the logs, we see that "crontab" was updated.

4. Taking a look at the crontab we see that at reboot /etc/darklord.sh is called

5. Checking the content of /etc/darklord.sh , it can be seen that the initialization of the malicious process is carried out in this script. Thus it is the culprit.

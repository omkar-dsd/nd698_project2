Create apache-user:

sudo adduser apache-user

Create apache-group:

sudo groupadd apache-group

Add apache-user to apache-group:

sudo usermod -aG apache-group apache-user

Changes Required to run apache as new user and group:

1. Update the following variables in /etc/apache2/envvars

    export APACHE_RUN_USER=apache-user
    export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=apache-group

2. Permission / Ownership changes for the corresponding directories:

    sudo chown -R apache-user:apache-group /var/www/html/*
    sudo chown -R apache-user:apache-group /var/lock/apache2
    sudo chown -R apache-user:apache-group /var/log/apache2

Reboot after the config changes

We can additionally restrict the user privileges by making allowances/denials in sudoers file and also chroot JAIL can be used to enhance the isolation and security.
